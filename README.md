# Arrhythmia-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-using-CNN-
Automated arrhythmia detection using deep learning with CNNs to classify and analyze heart rhythm irregularities, providing a reliable diagnostic tool for healthcare professionals.

#Overview
Arrhythmias are deviations from the normal heart rhythm and can be broadly classified into three types:

**Atrial
*Ventricular
*Supraventricular

The most frequently occurring arrhythmias include:

*Atrial Fibrillation
*Premature Ventricular Contractions
*Supraventricular Tachycardia
*Ventricular Tachycardia
*Atrial Flutter

Using computer-based algorithms to realize automatic detection of arrhythmia can provide a more effective and reliable diagnostic basis for medical workers. This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze and detect arrhythmias automatically, enhancing the accuracy and speed of diagnosis.

# Description
This project focuses on the automatic detection and classification of various types of arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms) using Deep Learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Accurate detection of these irregularities is essential for early intervention and effective treatment. By applying CNN models, this project aims to enhance the accuracy and speed of arrhythmia detection, providing a valuable tool to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing heart rhythm abnormalities.

# Features
